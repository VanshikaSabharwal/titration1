                  <ul>
                  <li>   &#9755; 17th Century Origins: Titration originated in the 17th century with the work of Robert Boyle, who introduced the concept of chemical analysis to determine substance proportions.</li>
<br>
               <li>   &#9755; 19th Century Advancements: The 19th century brought significant progress, with Karl Friedrich Mohr's development of standardized solutions and indicators in the Mohr method.</li>
                <br>
               <li>   &#9755; 1930s Breakthrough: Karl Fischer's invention of the Karl Fischer titration method in the 1930s revolutionized moisture content analysis.</li>
                <br>
               <li>   &#9755; Modern Automation: In the 20th century, automated titration systems emerged, enhancing precision and efficiency in analytical chemistry applications.</li>

              <!-- <p><ul>
                <li>   &#9755; Acid-Base Titration: Like a taste test for sour candies, but with chemicals. We're trying to find the perfect balance of "sourness." </li>

                <li>   &#9755; Redox Titration: It's like a chemical seesaw some elements lose electrons, others gain, and we're here to weigh the changes. </li>
                
                <li>   &#9755; Complexometric Titration: Think of it as a dating game for metal ions. Some ligands are just better at forming stable relationships! </li>
                
                <li>   &#9755; Karl Fischer Titration: The method so accurate, it can tell you if water's been crying in your sample. "Why so salty, H2O?" </li>

                  <li>   &#9755; Titration Today: In the modern age, titration is our trusty chemical sidekick, allowing us to decipher the secrets of substances accurately.</li>
<br>
                  <li>   &#9755; A Path to Precision: It's the key to measuring, mixing, and understanding ingredients, helping us create a brighter and safer future through science.</li>

              <ul>
              <li> &#9755;Accurate Measurements: Our aim is to precisely measure the components in a mixture, like a chef measuring ingredients for a perfect recipe. </li>

<li> &#9755;Quality Assurance: Titration helps ensure that products are of high quality and safe for use, just like a quality control inspector checks items for defects. </li>

<li> &#9755;Environmental Responsibility: We use titration to monitor and minimize the impact of chemicals on our environment, making the world a cleaner and healthier place. </li>
